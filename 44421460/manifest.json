                    "What would you change if you could go back in time?\n\n\nIn a small back alley in Tokyo, there is a caf� which has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. But this coffee shop offers its customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time.\n\nIn Before the Coffee Gets Cold, we meet four visitors, each of whom is hoping to make use of the caf��s time-travelling offer, in order to: confront the man who left them, receive a letter from their husband whose memory has been taken by early onset Alzheimer's, to see their sister one last time, and to meet the daughter they never got the chance to know.\n\nBut the journey into the past does not come without risks: customers must sit in a particular seat, they cannot leave the caf�, and finally, they must return to the present before the coffee gets cold . . .\n\nToshikazu Kawaguchi�s beautiful, moving story explores the age-old question: what would you change if you could travel back in time? More importantly, who would you want to meet, maybe for one last time?"
