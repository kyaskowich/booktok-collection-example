                    "The Fault in Our Stars meets Eleanor and Park in this exhilarating and heart-wrenching love story about a girl who learns to live from a boy who intends to die.\n\nSoon to be a major motion picture starring Elle Fanning!\n�\nTheodore Finch is fascinated by death, and he constantly thinks of ways he might kill himself. But each time, something good, no matter how small, stops him.\n�\nViolet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister�s recent death.\n�\nWhen Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, it�s unclear who saves whom. And when they pair up on a project to discover the �natural wonders� of their state, both Finch and Violet make more important discoveries: It�s only with Violet that Finch can be himself�a weird, funny, live-out-loud guy who�s not such a freak after all. And it�s only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violet�s world grows, Finch�s begins to shrink.\n�\nThis is an intense, gripping novel perfect for fans of Jay Asher, Rainbow Rowell, John Green, Gayle Forman, and Jenny Downham from a talented new voice in YA, Jennifer Niven."
