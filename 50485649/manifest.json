                    "Six friends. \nOne college reunion. \nOne unsolved murder.\n \nA college reunion turns dark and deadly in this chilling and propulsive suspense novel about six friends, one unsolved murder, and the dark secrets they�ve been hiding from each other�and themselves�for a decade.\n\nTen years after graduation, Jessica Miller has planned her triumphant return to southern, elite Duquette University, down to the envious whispers that are sure to follow in her wake. Everyone is going to see the girl she wants them to see�confident, beautiful, indifferent�not the girl she was when she left campus, back when Heather�s murder fractured everything, including the tight bond linking the six friends she�d been closest to since freshman year. Ten years ago, everything fell apart, including the dreams she worked for her whole life�and her relationship with the one person she wasn�t supposed to love. \n\nBut not everyone is ready to move on. Not everyone left Duquette ten years ago, and not everyone can let Heather�s murder go unsolved. Someone is determined to trap the real killer, to make the guilty pay. When the six friends are reunited, they will be forced to confront what happened that night�and the years� worth of secrets each of them would do anything to keep hidden.\n\nTold in racing dual timelines, with a dark campus setting and a darker look at friendship, love, obsession, and ambition, In My Dreams I Hold A Knife is an addictive, propulsive read you won�t be able to put down."
